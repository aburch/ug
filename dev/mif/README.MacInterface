This directory contains the files needed for the UG 
graphical interface for Apple Macintosh.

Until the introduction of MacOS X (Server) the
Interface was programmed using the MacOS Toolbox
functionality; these files were needed:

MacGraph.c
MacGraph.h
MacMain.c
MacMain.h
MacMain.m
MacShell.c
MacShell.h
MacSurface.c
MacSurface.h
mif.make
ugrsrc.r

With the introduction of MacOS X (Server) a new
interface was needed.  For MacOS X Server the interface
uses the DisplayPostscript Functions; MacOS X will be build
ariound the Carbon Programers interface.  Both versions
will use the YellowBox Frameworks for non-graphical
programming.

Files needed for MacOS X start with a capital M.

Since there will be two settings for ARCH, namely
MACOSXSERVER and MACOSX, the decision wether 
DisplayPostscript or Carbon should be used can be 
detected therefrom.

When invoked from 'ugmake' the Makefile 'Makefile.mif' is used.
The other Makefiles ('Makefile', 'Makefile.preample' and
'Makefile.postamble') are inherited from the ProjectBuilder.
