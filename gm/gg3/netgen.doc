A short documentation about netgen:

In this directory and below you find a part of the 3D mesh-generator NETGEN,
developed by Joachim Schoeberl at the Johannes Kepler Universitaet Linz.

This part is able to dissect a volume given by boundary triangles into
tetrahedrons. Also a mesh smoother is contained in this package.

The source files are splitted into the following directories:

meshing:     files for mesh-generation
general:     files for abstract data types (ARRAY, HASHTABLE, ...)
geom:        files for geometric objects
linalg:      files for linear algebra 
opti:        files for BFGS - optimization

The principle of NETGEN is explaind in
