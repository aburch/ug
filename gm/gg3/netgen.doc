netgen - 3d grid generator

INSTALLATION:
Do the following steps.
.n 1) Fill out the netgenlicence $(UGROOT)/gm/gg3/netgenlisencs.ps. 
.n 2) You will obtain the missing file ruler3.cc. 
.n    Copy it in $(UGROOT)/gm/gg3/netgen/meshing.
.n 3) Set NETGEN = ON in ug.conf. 	
.n 4) Edit the machines file of your mk.arch.
.n    Fill in ARCH_C++ and ARCH_C++FLAGS
.n 5) Call 'ugmake netgen'.  
	     
HOW TO USE THE GRIDGENERATOR:
Include

.vb
bnodes $h 0.5;
makegrid $s 2;
.ve
in your script. This generates a surface triangulation with step size 0.5
and it generates a grid. Then, 2 smoothing steps are performed to
optimize the inner angles. See $(UGROOT)/../cd/appl/scripts/mg.init for an example.

SHORT DESCRIPTION:

In this directory and below you find a part of the 3D mesh-generator NETGEN,
developed by Joachim Schoeberl at the Johannes Kepler Universitaet Linz.

This part is able to dissect a volume given by boundary triangles into
tetrahedrons. Also a mesh smoother is contained in this package.

The source files are splitted into the following directories.

. meshing -     files for mesh-generation
. general -     files for abstract data types (ARRAY, HASHTABLE, ...)
. geom    -     files for geometric objects
. linalg  -     files for linear algebra 
. opti    -     files for BFGS - optimization

The principle of NETGEN is explaind in
