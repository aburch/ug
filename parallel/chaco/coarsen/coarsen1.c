/*
  Generate matching.
  Construct mapping from vtxs to coarsened vtxs (v2cv).
  Count edges in coarsened graph.
  Allocate space for new graph.
  Fill in adjacency fields and vertex weights.
  Compute edge weights.
    For all original edges {
      sum weights into corresponding coarsened edges.
      (Note: contracted edges don't get included.)
      adjust weights of coarsened edges to account for missing contracted edges.
    }

    The adjustment of coarsened edge weights proceeds as follows:
    (i) Randomly permute list of matching edges
        (Since weight adjustment is order dependent.)
    (iii) For all contracted edges:
	 Use mapping from old to new edges to identify nonparallel edges.
	 Adjust weights as if these were the only edges.

    This final numerical adjustment involves the following process:
    (a) Compute z values that minimize the sum of kz^2.
    (b) Assume merged vertices end up at center of mass.
    (c) Choose new k's to preserve forces on non-merged vertices.

    (The implicit assumption here is that the z values for the vtxs adjacent
     to a merged vertex are equal.  I only apply this to edges that won't
     collapse onto each other in the coarsened graph.)
