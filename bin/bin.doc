   unixcommands - UNIX shell commands provided by ug (only for UNIX)
   
   DESCRIPTION:
   ug provides a couple of commands to be invoked from a UNIX shell to
   ease the handling of the ug software:~
   
.  ugman - print out a ug manual entry (equivalent to 'man' with appropriate paths)
.  ugproject - compiles all libraries and applications shipped with the current distribution
.  xugman - browser for ug manual entries (equivalent to 'xman' with appropriate paths)
.  ugclean - clean source code [and ug libraries]
.  ugmake - call make with the right Makefile*

   DEPENDENCIES:
   These commands are available only in an UNIX environment.
   
   SEE ALSO:
   commands, ugman, ugproject, xugman, installation, machines

/*D
   ugman - prints out an ug manual entry (only for UNIX)
   
   CALL:
   'ugman [section] title ...'
   
   or all other variants your 'man' command allows   
   
   DESCRIPTION:
   'ugman' accesses information from the on-line version of the ug
   documentation. Since it passes all the arguments to the 'man'
   command of your operating system you can use all supported
   variants of your common 'man' command. For further explanations see
   there.
   
   Before you can use the 'ugman' command you have to define the paths
   to the ug and application manual pages in the environment variable
   '$UGMAN'. For details see the manual page for `Installation`.
   
   DEPENDENCIES:
.  $UGMAN - The environment variable '$UGMAN' must point to the paths where
   the manual pages are stored. See manual page for `Installation`.
.  man - Because ugman uses the 'man' command it is not available on MacIntosh.
.  gnroff,doctext - In principal you could modify the man pages and  regenerate
   them. To do that you would our modified version of Bill Gropps 'doctext' version
   and the 'gnroff' software.
.  MacIntosh - 'man' is not available on MacIntosh.
   
   BUGS:
   Due to limitations of the 'man' command concerning the searched 
   directory names 
   it is not possible to view manual pages of any experimenting environment.
   Use instead of it the 'xugman' command.

   ugproject - shell script that compiles all applications 

   DESCRIPTION:
   This shell scripts compiles and builds all applications shipped with the
   current distribution of ug3. It also builds all libraries needed for the
   different applications.
   
   BUG:
   If an error occurs during the compilation the 'ugproject' command aborts
   leaving an inconsistent state of ug: your 'ug.conf' file is stored
   as 'ug.conf.orig' and the ug library has the state due to the incomplete
   compilation. To repair this inconsistancy move back the config file and
   rebuild ug:~
   
.n  mv $UGROOT/ug.conf.orig $UGROOT/ug.conf
.n  ugmake
