/*D
   unixcommands - UNIX shell commands provided by ug (only for UNIX)
   
   DESCRIPTION:
   ug provides a couple of commands to be invoked from a UNIX shell to
   lighten the handling of the ug software:~
   
.  ugman - print out a ug manual entry (equivalent to 'man')
.  ugproject - checks soundness of all standard experimenting environment
.  xugman - browser for ug manual entries (equivalent to 'xman')
.  ugclean - clean source code [and ug libraries]
.  ugmake - call make with the right Makefile*

   DEPENDENCIES:
   This commands are available only in an UNIX environment.
   
   SEE ALSO:
   commands, ugman, ugproject, xugman, installation, machines

/*D
   ugman - prints out an ug manual entry (only for UNIX)
   
   CALL:
   'ugman [section] title ...'
   
   or all other variants your 'man' command allows   
   
   DESCRIPTION:
   'ugman' accesses information from the on-line version of the ug
   documentation. Since it passes all the arguments to the 'man'
   command of your operating system you can use all supported
   variants of your common 'man' command. For further explanations see
   there.
   
   Before you can use the 'ugman' command you have to define the paths
   to the ug and application manual pages in the environment variable
   '$UGMAN'. For details see the manual for `installation`.
   
   DEPENDENCIES:
.  $UGMAN - The environment variable '$UGMAN' must point to the paths where
   the manual pages are stored. See manual page for `install`.
.  man - Because 
   ugman uses the 'man' command it is not available on MacIntosh.
.  nroff - The 
   manual pages are not pre-formatted by nroff. So the UNIX
   utilities 'nroff', 'neqn' and 'tbl' must be present to format 
   the current page. On SGI 'nroff' is available only as an extra to
   pay product in the "Documentors Work Bench". The call sequence 
   would be e.g.
.n '~~~~~neqn' `page.1` '| tbl | nroff -man >' `page`'; pack -f' `page`

. MacIntosh - 'man' is not available on MacIntosh.
.  SGI - On SGI 'nroff' is available only as an extra to
   pay product in the "Documentors Work Bench".
   
   BUGS:
   Due to limitations of the 'man' command concerning the searched 
   directory names 
   it is not possible to view manual pages of any experimenting environment.
   Use instead of it the 'xugman' command.

/*D
   ugproject - checks soundness of all standard experimenting environments

   DESCRIPTION:
   Compiles all standard experimenting environments in order to check the
   compilability of the ug3 software. This command should be invoked after
   each change to the ug kernel or the standard problemclass libraries.
   Watch the bug!
   
   BUG:
   If an error occurs during the compilation the 'ugproject' command aborts
   leaving an inconsistent state of ug: your 'ug.conf' file is stored
   as 'ug.conf.orig' and the ug library has the state due to the incomplete
   compilation. To repair this inconsistancy move back the config file and
   rebuild ug:~
   
.n  mv $UGROOT/ug.conf.orig $UGROOT/ug.conf
.n  ugmake
