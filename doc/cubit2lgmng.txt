This file describes how to create lgm and ng files for UG
using the cubit mesh generation toolkit.

1. How to create a lgm domain file with cubit

This involves four steps

1.1 Here is a sample cubit journal file which 
creates two files:
- a surface mesh file cyli_lgm.gen and
- a log file with necessary information which
	cannot be reconstructed from the surface mesh
	file. The information includes volumes ids and 
	curve information of surfaces.

# construct a consistent geometry
import iges '../models/cylinder_in_box_asm.igs'
body all scale 0.001
imprint body all #keep
body 1 copy
subtract body 3 from 2
merge all

# mesh the surfaces
curve all size 1
surface all scheme trimesh
mesh surface all

# write associativity information in surface mesh file
set nodeset Associativity on
set nodeset Associativity Complete on

# write the surface mesh file 
# in netcdf exodus II format
export genesis 'cyli_lgm.gen'

# logfile with additional information
logging on file 'cyli.log'
list volume all
list surface all


1.2 Transform the surface mesh file in readable format
	
This uses the netcdf tools ncdump
ncdump cyli_lgm.gen > cyli_lgm.gen.txt


1.3 Add logfile info to the surface mesh file

ugexo2lgm_amd cyli.log cyli_lgm.gen.txt


1.4 Create a lgm domain file

ugexo2lgm cyli_lgm.gen.txt cyli.lgm


2. How to create a ng file with cubit
