20040115:
	1. introduce cp into testboard for web page
	2. switching compilers
	3. integration of test into UG Makefile mechanism
	4. distinction between not applicable (NA) tests and failed builds (NOTRUN)
		-> may modifications in Dart/Source/Client/test.tcl  and Dart/Source/Server/Dashboard.xsl
			are necessary
	5. restructuring of BUILD TEST SUBMIT cycle
		-> perform all possible builds + perform all possible test
		-> this avoids 4.
	6. script for EXPERIMENTAL builds and tests
