HOWTO for UG
============

Purpose:
	- explain gory practical or conceptual details when using UG 
	- with growing contents it should be a helpful
	  and time saving database

Structure:
	- explanations are structured in a module by module 
	  manner

Usage:
	- grep this HOWTO via keywords or 
    - try to find a section of interest concerning with
	  the problem you have

Extensions:
	- evereyone using UG is welcome to contribute
	- please document all problems, also these which seem
	  to be "easy" or clear after you solved them.
	  Our mind is a subtile thing.

Mantainance:
	- should get a small rework of its structure and
	  content every few month(?)

Vector plotobject:

-	How can I change the size of vectors?

	Use "setplotobject EVector $c 0 $t 0.1 $l <n>", 
	where $c 0 indicated no cutting of vectors,
	$l <n> is the cutlengthfactor between [0.1,10].  
	Additionally use "findrange $z <f>"  <f> in [0.1,0.25]
	to scale the values.

ugpfm: 

ugpfm is for merging parallel datafiles/directories into their
sequential counterpart.
To read in the sequential file(s) increase the heap size in the
loaddata command with the $h option, since the file(s) contain
the heap size allocated by a single of the former parallel 
processes. This heap size is in most cases to small for the
big sequential multigrid of the merged file(s) and the resulting 
error gives no hint towards increasing the heap size.
