Set up Dart for UG (client usage) 

1. Download Dart

Download Dart by using cvs

 cvs -d :pserver:anonymous@public.kitware.com:/Dart/cvsroot login
 (respond with password dart) 

Follow this command by checking out the source code:
 
 cvs -d :pserver:anonymous@public.kitware.com:/Dart/cvsroot co Dart



2. Setting some environment variables in shell resource file

There are two environment variables that have to be set in .tcshrc, .cshrc, ..., 
one for Dart and one for UG.

(i)  DART_HOME has to be set to the root of your Dart installation (../Dart).
(ii) UGROOT has to be set to "../UG/ug"

Further more the environmental path has to be extended that it contains 
the directory "../UG/ug/bin". This is also described in the UG manual.



3. Setting up Dart for UG to use it with our Dart server

First of all you need an installation of Tcl and ssh on your system because
the configure/build/test cycle is driven by Tcl scripts and the data is
copied to the Dart server via scp.
The only thing left to do is defining tests. There are several tests 
predefined and when you want to add your own tests all you have to do is to
create a file called "DartTestfile.txt" in the directory in which the 
executable to be tested will reside after building UG. This file should 
contain the following command

 ADD_TEST(TestIdentifier ExecutableName [Arguments]).

The ExecutableName can be any executable build within UG or any other 
executable that exists on your system. The TestIdentifier is a name for the 
test which appears on the dashboard and which has to be unique.



4. Running the configure/build/test/submit cycle

There are scripts in ../UG/ug/bin which you can use to run a cycle.
For further information on these scripts see the README_SCRIPTS.txt file.
