   makefiles - maintain, update, and regenerate `ug` libraries 

   SYNOPSIS:
   makefiles 

   DESCRIPTION:
.  local~makefile - Each `ug` source code directory contains its own local 
   makefile named Makefile.<dir>. 
   At present the following subdirectories do exist in $UGROOT: low/, dev/ and 
   the version dependent gm/, graph/ and ui/. For example
   a makefile in directory ui/ would be named Makefile.ui. 

.  version~dependencies -
   Version dependencies like dimension (2 or 3) and positions of dregrees 
   of freedom are to be specified in the file $UGROOT/ug.conf. Herein a library 
   name suffix $(LIBSUFFIX) is created, which will be added to a name of a
   library by a local makefile. One example library suffix shall be given as 
   lib2TFFF, with the number 2 indicating the dimension and the following 
   four letters indicating which degrees of freedom (NODEDATA, EDGEDATA, 
   SIDEDATA, and ELEMDATA) are used in the corresponding geometric object.
   T stands for TRUE while F matches FALSE.

.  includes -
   Three basic files are included by any local makefile in `ug`,
   $UGROOT/ug.conf, $UGROOT/ug.arch and $UGROOT/machines/mk.<m>.
   While the purpose of ug.conf was already discussed above, ug.arch bears
   the name of the architecture `ug` will be compiled for, e.g. ARCHDIR = HP
   for HP workstations. 
   $UGROOT/machines/mk.<m>, takes care of all architecture dependent makefile 
   entries like library pathnames for XLIB, compile an link flags etc.
   Here <m> specifies the machine used (e.g. mk.HP).

.  global~makefile -
   The global makefile /ug/Makefile executes all local `ug` makefiles 
   in hierarchical order and generates the version dependent 
   `ug` library $UGROOT/lib/libug$(LIBSUFFIX).a. 
 
.  executables -
   In order to receive the executable demonstration 
   programs execute the 'ugproject' shell script.
