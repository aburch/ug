   Installation - How to install UG in an UNIX environment
   
DESCRIPTION:
   This document explains, how to install the UG software in an 
   UNIX environment. A full installation requires that you received the
   missing header file 'gm.h' by email. You will get this file after
   completing the license form (see below). However you can extract UG 
   in order to read the manual pages without having the missing header
   file.
   
GETTING UG FROM THE SERVER:
   In order to obtain the UG package you have to do the following.
   Go to a directory where you want to install UG, then execute the following
   ftp session.

.vb
   > ftp dom.ica3.uni-stuttgart.de
   Connected to dom.ica3.uni-stuttgart.de.
   220 dom FTP server (Version 1.7.193.3 Thu Jul 22 18:32:22 GMT 1993) ready.
   Name (dom.ica3.uni-stuttgart.de:peter): ftp
   331 Guest login ok, send ident as password.
   Password: <type in your complete email number here>
   230 Guest login ok, access restrictions apply.
   Remote system type is UNIX.
   Using binary mode to transfer files.
   ftp> cd pub/ug/ug31
   250 CWD command successful.
   ftp> get ug3##.tar.gz
   ftp> quit
.ve

   The file 'ug3##.tar.gz' with the highest number in '##' corresponds to the
   latest version of ug3. 
   Usually you should get the latest version, but older versions will be on the
   server in case of need.
   

EXTRACTING THE SOURCE CODE:
   We now suppose that the file 'ug3##.tar.gz' is in the directory
   where you want to install UG (all files will be placed in a 
   subdirectory anyway). To uncompress UG you will need the 'gzip'
   software!

.vb
     > gzip -d ug3##.tar.gz
     > tar xvf ug3##.tar
.ve 

   The result of these two commands should be a new subdirectory 'ug3##/'
   in your current directory.

EDITING YOUR RESOURCE FILE:
   In order to read UGs manual pages and to execute the shell scripts provided
   with UG you have to do two things. (1) define an environment variable UGROOT
   containing the location of UG in your file system. (2) You have to include the
   directory containing UGs shell scripts into your path.

   Suppose that you extracted UG in the directory '$HOME' (i.e. your home directory).
   In the following examples you will see how to change the resource file
   for various shells.

   C SHELLS AND SIMILAR

   For C Shells (csh or tcsh) insert the following two lines in the file 
   '$HOME/.cshrc' respectively '$HOME/.tcshrc'.

.vb
        setenv UGROOT $HOME/ug3##/ug
        set path = ( $path $UGROOT/bin )
.ve

   In order to make these changes effective you either have to start a new shell
   or type 

.vb
        source .cshrc   (or .tcshrc)
.ve


   POSIX OR BOURNE SHELLS (sh), KORN SHELL (ksh) AND KEYSHELL (keysh) 

   Insert the following two lines into your '$HOME/.profile' file.

.vb
        export UGROOT=$HOME/ug3##/ug
        export PATH=$PATH:$UGROOT/bin'
.ve

   and start a new shell

   Now you should be able to access the manual pages. If the 'man' program is
   in your path you can try typing

.vb
        ugman ug
.ve

   and you should see the ug overview page. If the program 'xman' is in your
   path then type

.vb
        xugman
.ve

   and the X manual browser should start up with the UG manual in the sections menu.


FULLFILL THE LICENSE REGULATIONS:
   In order to compile the UG software you need to fullfill the license
   regulations. To that end read the file 'README.license' in UGs root
   directory. Basically you must return TWO completed license forms to us
   and will send you back one copy by regular mail and a missing header
   file ('gm.h') by email. 

   WITHOUT THAT HEADER FILE YOU WILL NOT BE ABLE TO COMPILE THE SOFTWARE !


CONFIGURING UG:
   In order to configure UG for different machines you have to edit the
   file 'ug.arch' in the UG root directory 'ug3##/'. The machine definition
   in the 'ug.arch' file selects one of the 'mk.*' files in the 'ug3##/ug/machines'
   directory which is included into every UG makefile. 

   If your machine is already supported just select the corresponding entry
   in the 'ug.arch' file. In addition it may be necessary to edit the
   corresponding file in the 'ug3##/ug/machines' to set the correct paths
   to the libraries and include files, especially when you compiling for
   X windows.

   If your machine is not supported, you have to write an appropriate file
   'mk.<your machine>' in the 'ug3##/ug/machines' directory. In addition you
   have to specify a switch in the line defining the compiler flags:~

.vb
   CFLAGS = -D__<your machine>__ -c <additional options>
.ve

   Every ug source file includes the file 'ug3##/ug/low/compiler.h' which
   in turn can be used to make some compiler dependent definitions. Just
   look at this file, copy one of the entries and edit them to fit your
   machine. See the manual page 'compiler' (type 'ugman compiler') for
   additional details. The 'ALIGNMENT' and 'ALIGNMASK' are usually the
   important definitions.

COMPILING UG:
   If not already done, you should place the file 'gm.h' that you
   received by email in the directory 'ug3##/ug/gm'. Now you are ready to
   compile. To that end just type

.vb
       > ugproject
.ve

   which will compile all examples and libraries.

   If you want to build just the UG library without compiling a problem
   class library and an application you can do this by typing 'make'
   in the 'ug3##/ug/' directory. Before doing that you can specify a number of
   switches in the file 'ug3##/ug.conf'. These switches parametrize the
   UG library at compile time. The library will be given a unique name
   depending on these switches, so you can have several versions of the
   UG library at a time. The switches in 'ug.conf' have the following meaning.
   
.  DIM -  Sets the dimension you want to use. 2 and 3 dimensional
   calculations can be done. You can not change the dimension at any
   other place in the software.

   The NODEDATA,EDGEDATA, SIDEDATA, ELEMDATA switches have been removed
   to allow more flexibility.

DEPENDENCIES:
.  gm.h - This is the `key file` for the ug3 software. Without haveing it 
   installed you can not compile the software. In order to get this file see 
   you have to return the completed license form.
.  gzip(1),~tar(1) - These two UNIX commands are neccessary to get the files
   out of the packed archive file.

RELATED FILES:
   A copy of this text is contained in the root directory of the ug3 software. 

BUGS:
.  ug.conf - This file may be overwritten in some circumstances (e. g. by
   'ugproject'). Thus keep always a backup copy in the directory '$UGROOT/configs/'.
.  ugman/xugman - The man pages of the applications and problem classes are available
   only by 'xugman' and not by 'ugman'.
